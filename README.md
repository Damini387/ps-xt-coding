# ps-xt-coding

git clone `xp-app` to see the react application made for "launches by SpaceX program"

To run the Application, run below commands:
- `yarn install`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn start`

- `npm run server` - to run the node server, in order to fetch the launch programs

- `yarn run test` - to run the Jest

# Improvements (TODO)
- Add lazy loading
- Add proper error messages when data is not fetched
- Add variables and use in *.scss

# Issues
- Make clicks smoother

Thanks!
